# Shots-with-the-Bartender
99 Shots Site: https://99shots.netlify.app/

This is a Liquor App built for a small Bar near my City.
Licensed for 12 months use, just to see viability of selling more Licenses to other Bars in the future.
Proved to be popular with the Bartenders as it offered a diverse amount of Cocktails that they can make to surprise their Clients!

Built with HTML/CSS/JS/API - This app allowed me to diversiy my Freelancing scope!

Building this app will always be special as I learned patience with myself, as it was trying to design and build all facets of the App by myself!
