99 Shots Site: https://99shots.netlify.app/

This is a Liquor App built for a small Bar near my City. Licensed for 12 months use, just to see viability of selling more Licenses to other Bars in the future.
Proved to be popular with the Bartenders as it offered a diverse amount of Cocktails that they can make to surprise their Clients!

In future versions, I want to customize the Query Parameters to pull up a specific Drink when inputted within a Search Box.

Built with HTML/CSS/JS/API - This app allowed me to diversiy my Freelancing scope!
